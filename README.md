# Kidney-Disease-Classification
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately diagnose the presence of kidney disease in a person based on their medical test results. The model will then identify which factors are the most influential in determining a person's chances of developing kidney disease. The model's accuracy and performance is evaluated through cross-validation.
Ultimately, this project aims to provide a reliable tool for early detection and diagnosis of kidney disease, which could potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

# Procedure
- Perform EDA to check relationship of different predictor variables with respect to each other and also the target variable.
- Do data cleaning and preprocessing wherever required.
- Build models and predict whether a person will have chronic kideny disease (CKD) or not based on given features.
- Check which features played most important role in the prediction.
- Check why these particular features are responsible for the disease.
