# Kidney-Disease-Classification
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately diagnose the presence of kidney disease in a person based on their medical test results. The model will then identify which factors are the most influential in determining a person's chances of developing kidney disease. The model's accuracy and performance is evaluated through cross-validation.
Ultimately, this project aims to provide a reliable tool for early detection and diagnosis of kidney disease, which could potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

# Procedure
- Conducted data cleaning to ensure data accuracy by correcting data types and removing typographical errors in the dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to the relationship between predictor variables and the diagnosis result, as well as checking for multicollinearity.
- Imputed missing data using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Simple Imputed methods and compared their results.
- Built various classification models such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), KNN, and XGBoost, and compared their performances to select the best model.
- Conducted feature importance analysis to determine the most impactful features on the diagnosis of kidney disease and researched why these features had a significant impact.
